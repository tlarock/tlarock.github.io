<h2 id="content-overview">Content Overview</h2>
<p>This is an introductory course in algorithms. Although any computer program can be viewed as an implementation of an algorithm for solving a particular computational problem, in this course we focus not on the programs themselves but on the underlying computational problems, and general algorithmic techniques for solving these problems. In this course, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>See a wide range of computational problems arising in different applications</li>
<li>Learn how to formulate these problems precisely given somewhat informal descriptions</li>
<li>Learn new algorithmic design techniques used to solve these computational problems</li>
<li>Learn techniques to prove correctness of algorithms</li>
<li>Learn techniques to analyze the efficiency of algorithms</li>
<li>Learn how to transform algorithms to programs</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific topics typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic tools for analysis of algorithms: proof by induction, asymptotic notation</li>
<li>Divide-and-conquer algorithms</li>
<li>Dynamic programming</li>
<li>Stable matching: the Gale-Shapley Algorithm</li>
<li>Basic graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, topological sorting, shorest paths</li>
<li>Network flow algorithms and applications</li>
<li>NP-completeness</li>
<li>Greedy algorithms</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>
<p>I will assign readings from <a href="http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/#book">Jeff Erickson’s Algorithms book</a>, which is freely availabe online. I may also assign reading from the online version of <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/toc.htm">Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest</a>, which is a standard reference for an algorithms course (commonly referred to as CLR).</p>
<p>Originally, I was planning to assign readings from <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/algorithm-design-jon-kleinberg/1100018432">Algorithm Design by Kleinberg and Tardos</a>. Given the difficulty (and questionable morality) of acquiring books at the present moment, as well as potential for inequity in the ability of students living in different geographic areas to get the book, it is <em>not</em> required. If you can get an electronic version, or if you already have a copy, it will likely be a helpful resource and I encourage you to peruse it.</p>
<h2 id="canvas">Canvas</h2>
<p>Outside of Zoom lectures, our course materials will be located on this webpage and Canvas. Generally I will prefer to update this webpage and use Canvas mostly for keeping track of assignment submissions and grades. If you are unable to access Canvas, let me know in an email.</p>
<h2 id="piazza">Piazza</h2>
<p>We are using <a href="piazza.com">Piazza</a> for question and answer. If you are in the class but not enrolled in Piazza, send me an email.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>As the instructor of the course, I am committed to maintaining a positive learning environment based upon communication, mutual learning, and respect. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in this class will be appreciated and given serious consideration. The university does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, color, or national origin. If you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with Disability Resource Center (617) 373-4428. I will accomodate any and all accessibility requrests to the best of my ability. Some accomodation requests should come to me via the University. However, if you have an accomodation request that would not be officially communicated to me via the University, or if you would like to talk to me about University accomodation, please feel free to contact me about it.</p>
<h2 id="more-details-on-course-structure">More details on course structure</h2>
<p>I encourage you to consider “choosing” between two ways to take this course:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Synchonously. You attend most lectures live as if it were an in-person ccourse. This option has more opportunities for interaction with me and your peers.</li>
<li>Asynchronously. You watch the recordings of the lectures rather than attending them live.</li>
</ol>
<p>I put “choosing” in quotes because there is no formal necessity to choose a specific way of engaging with the material, and because some students may not have a choice given time differences. For those who are in a position to choose, I expect it to be helpful to commit to one or the other way and give it a try. You may then revise your thinking and choose the other option, or something in between (I expect many students to fall somwehere in between).</p>
<p>More information about what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lectures Monday-Thursday 1:30-3:10 via Zoom and recorded.
<ul>
<li>Students can choose to attend the lectures live and engage/ask questions, but no one will be penalized for not attending</li>
<li>Watching the lectures is assumed. It is not “required” but anything discussed in lectures is fair game for homework/exams</li>
<li>For students who attend live, there may be a couple of “check in” questions throughout to make sure people are following. These questions will have no impact on your grade, they are just to make sure we are on the same page.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Approximately weekly homework assignments
<ul>
<li>Collaboration encouraged, but must submit own work (see below)!</li>
<li>Looking for help using web resources (e.g. youtube videos) is acceptable. Finding an exact answer online and copying it is not.
<ul>
<li>If you do find the answer somehow and can’t “unsee it”, you can let me know.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Exams
<ul>
<li>2 midterms and 1 final exam. I anticipate all will be take-home format, meaning they will be similar to a homework assignment except time will be limited and neither collaboration or use of the Internet for help will be allowed.</li>
<li>We will do some sort of recitation, most likely a brief rehash of the topics we covered and a Q&amp;A session, before each exam is released.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="detailed-homework-policies">Detailed homework policies</h2>
<ul>
<li>All homework solutions must be typeset in LaTeX. I will provide the source files for the HW assignments to help you get started. Learning LaTeX can take some time, but is well worth the investment, since most technical publications are written in LaTeX. Great editors exist on most platforms. I use TeXstudio on Mac and have heard that it is good across platforms. <a href="overleaf.com">Overleaf</a> is a nice online TeX editor, like Google Docs for TeX. The <a href="https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf">not so short introduction to LaTeX</a> is a good reference to get you started.</li>
<li>I encourage you to work with your classmates on the homework problems. If you do collaborate, you must write all solutions by yourself, in your own words, and are strictly forbidden from sharing any written solutions. You must list all of your collaborators on your submission. The TAs and I reserve the right to ask you explain your solutions.</li>
<li>If you use an online resource to develop your solution, please note it somehow in your submission, including the URL.</li>
<li>The lowest homework score will be dropped from your grade.</li>
<li>Given that our course runs on a very compressed timeline, it is important that work is turned in on time. Extensions will be considered only if asked for in advance of the deadline and granted on a case by case basis. Please do your best to plan ahead and try to ask for permission rather than forgiveness!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-plagiarism-policy">General Plagiarism Policy</h2>
<p>I take academic honesty seriously, and you should too. The Northeastern University Policy on Academic Integrity can be found at: <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/">http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/</a></p>
<p>In general, in this course it is not considered cheating if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work together on homework assignments, as long as you each work out and submit your own final answers, noting your collaborators</li>
<li>Get help from professors, peers, tutors, etc. on the homework assignments</li>
<li>Work together on preparing for quizzes and exams</li>
</ul>
<p>It is considered cheating if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit work done by others (without your participation) as your own</li>
<li>Submit the same writeup as others, regardless of whether you note that you collaborated</li>
<li>Copy or collaborate on exams</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>The final course grade will be computed based on a weighted average of:</p>
<ul>
<li>homework (45%)</li>
<li>two midterms (15% each)</li>
<li>final exam (25%)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-brief-note-on-the-times">A brief note on the times</h2>
<p>As you are all well aware, we are in the middle of a global pandemic. This has already impacted our course significantly, moving it from in person to online. All of us are likely expereincing stress and difficulty because of these circumstances in specific ways. I promise to you that I am going to do my best to be patient and lenient where possible during this course. If you are going through something that is impacting your ability to succeed, please let me know (in whatever amount of detail (or lack therof) you feel comfortable). If you know you will be unable to complete an assignment and need an extension, ask in advance. Of course there are limitations to my power, but I will do my best to accomodate all individual circumstances.</p>
