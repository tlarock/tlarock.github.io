## Time & Location
Lectures will be recorded live via Zoom at the scheduled course time: 

<b> Monday - Thursday 1:30 - 3:30PM </b>

More detailed information about course structure is below.

## Staff
Instructor: [Timothy LaRock](tlarock.github.io), [email address](mailto:larock.t@northeastern.edu)

Teaching Assistants: There are X TAs for the course. They are available as a resource for you as well, please reach out to them. TAs will be available to help you and will handle grading of homework/exams.


## Instructor Office hours
* I will hold “open” office hours for a few hours a week in my Zoom room.
* We can either have whole room discussions or break out into smaller rooms, depending on the needs of the people who attend. 
* If you feel you need significant help, it is probably better if we make appointments to meet 1-1 (or a couple of students and me). Please email me to schedule an appointment!
* I encourage people to drop by if they would like to chat, but of course we will be prioritizing courswwork discussions.

## TA Office Hours

Canvas: TBD

##  Content Overview
This is an introductory course in algorithms. Although any computer program can be viewed as an implementation of an algorithm for solving a particular computational problem, in this course we focus not on the programs themselves but on the underlying computational problems, and general algorithmic techniques for solving these problems. In this course, we will:

* See a wide range of computational problems arising in different applications
* Learn how to formulate these problems precisely given somewhat informal descriptions
* Learn new algorithmic design techniques used to solve these computational problems
* Learn techniques to prove correctness of algorithms
* Learn techniques to analyze the efficiency of algorithms
* Learn how to transform algorithms to programs 

Specific topics typically include:

* Basics tools for analysis of algorithms: proof by induction, asymptotic notation
* Divide-and-conquer algorithms
* Dynamic programming
* Stable matching: the Gale-Shapley Algorithm
* Basic graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, topological sorting, shorest paths
* Network flow algorithms and applications
* NP-completeness
* Greedy algorithms 

## Textbook
I will assign some readings from [Algorithm Design by Kleinberg and Tardos](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/algorithm-design-jon-kleinberg/1100018432).

I am not going to strictly require that you get the book, especially during a pandemic. I will do my best not to lean on the text, but the book is a helpful introduction and I recommend reading it if you can. However, if obtaining a copy of the book is burdensome, please let me know and I can try to get you a copy for the semester, or, if too many people cannot get access, I may consider just dropping the book altogether.

## Accessibility
I will accomodate any and all accessibility requrests to the best of my ability. Some accomodations will come to me via the University. However, if you have an accomodation request that would not be officially communicated to me via the University, please feel free to contact me about it.

## More details on course structure
I encourage you to consider "choosing" between two ways to take this course:
 
1. Synchonously. You attend every lecture live as if it were an in-person ccourse. This option has more opportunities for interaction with me and your peers.
2. Asynchronously. You watch the recordings of the lectures rather than attending them live. 

I put "choosing" in quotes because there is no formal necessity to choose a specific way of engaging with the material, but I expect it to be helpful to commit to one or the other way and give it a try. You may then revise your thinking and choose the other option, or something in between (I expect most students to fall somwehere in between).

More information about what to expect:

* Lectures Monday-Thursday 1:30-3:10 via Zoom and recorded.
    * Students can choose to attend the lectures live and engage/ask questions, but no one will be penalized for not attending
    * Watching the lectures is assumed. It is not “required” but anything discussed in lectures is fair game for homework/exams
    * For students who attend live, there may be a couple of “check in” questions throughout to make sure people are following. These questions will have no impact on your grade, they are just to make sure we are on the same page. 
    * I anticipate leaving some time at the end of many lectures for an informal help session about homework or upcoming exams
* Weekly homework assignments
    * We will release the weekly homework assignment after first lecture of the week and they will be due Friday nights at 6PM.
    * The assignments will roughly correspond to completing 1 problem per day.
    * Collaboration encouraged, but must submit own work (see below)!
    * Looking for help using web resources (e.g. youtube videos) is acceptable. Finding an exact answer online and copying it is not.
        * If you do find the answer somehow and can't "unsee it", you can let me know.
* Exams
    * Take home format. Very similar to a homework assignment but collaboration is not allowed.
    * We will do some sort of recitation, more likely a brief rehash of the topics we covered and a Q&A session, before the exam is released.

## Detailed homework policies
* All homework solutions must be typeset in LaTeX. I will provide the source files for the HW assignments to help you get started. See below for some advice on LaTeX. Learning LaTeX can take some time, but is well worth the investment, since most technical publications are written in LaTeX. Great editors exist on most platforms. I use TeXstudio on Mac and have heard that it is good across platforms. The [not so short introduction to LaTeX](https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf) is a good reference to get you started.
* The lowest homework score will be dropped from your grade.
* I encourage you to work with your classmates on the homework problems. If you do collaborate, you must write all solutions by yourself, in your own words, and are strictly forbidden from sharing any written solutions. You must list all of your collaborators on your submission. The TAs and I reserve the right to ask you explain your solutions.

## Grading
Final grading structure TBD.
<!--The final course grade will be computed based on a weighted average of:

homework (45%)
two midterms (15% each)
final exam (25%)
-->

## A note on the times
As you are all well aware, we are going to be learning together during a pandemic. These times are likely confusing, stressful, and difficult for all of us in specific ways. I promise to you that I am going to do my best to be patient and lenient where possible during this course. If you are going through something that is impacting your ability to succeed, please let me know. If you need an extension, ask. Of course there are limitations to my power, but I will do my best to accomodate all individual circumstances.
