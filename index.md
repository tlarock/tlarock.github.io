## <a name="research"></a> Research
My research falls at the intersection of network science, data mining and machine learning. In particular, my research seeks to identify and understand sequential patterns and dependencies in network data, such as passenger movement through public transit systems, goods through logistics networks, or users navigating the Web. I am also interested in using machine learning to improve partially observed (sampled) network data, as well as the limitations of these approaches.

I am a third year doctoral student in Network Science at Northeastern University's Network Science Institute, advised by [Tina Eliassi-Rad](www.eliassi.org). Prior to joining the Institute in 2016, I completed a BS in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Philosophy at the State University of New York at Albany, where I conducted research on load balancing in cellular networks and unsupervised transmitter detection in wireless frequency spectrum data, under the supervision of Prof. Petko Bogdanov and Prof. Mariya Zheleva. You can find a copy of my CV [here](img/LaRock_Tim_CV.pdf) and my Google Scholar page [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kAaxRkUAAAAJ&hl=en).
