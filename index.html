		<h3> Bio </h3>
		<p>
		Tim is a third year doctoral student advised by Tina Eliassi-Rad. His work falls at the intersection of network science, data mining and machine learning. In particular, Timâ€™s research seeks to identify and understand sequential patterns and dependencies in network data, such as passenger movement through public transit systems, goods through logistics networks, or users navigating the Web. Prior to joining the Institute in 2016, Tim completed a BS in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Philosophy at the State University of New York at Albany, where he conducted research on load balancing in cellular networks and unsupervised transmitter detection in wireless frequency spectrum data, under the supervision of Prof. Petko Bogdanov and Prof. Mariya Zheleva.</p>
