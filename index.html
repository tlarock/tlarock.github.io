<p>Beginning in April 2022 I will be a postdoctoral research associate
at the Oxford Mathematical Institute, working with <a
href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/renaud.lambiotte">Professor
Renaud Lambiotte</a> on modeling multi-way interaction data on networks.
In December 2021 I earned my PhD in Network Science at the Northeastern
University <a href="https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org">Network
Science Institute</a>, where I was advised by <a
href="https://www.eliassi.org">Professor Tina Eliassi-Rad</a> and
specialized in the analysis of higher-order sequential correlations in
network data. Prior to joining the Institute in 2016, I completed a BS
in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Philosophy
at the State University of New York at Albany, where I conducted
research on load balancing in cellular networks and unsupervised
transmitter detection in wireless frequency spectrum data, under the
supervision of Prof. Petko Bogdanov and Prof. Mariya Zheleva.</p>

<p>My research falls at the intersection of network science, data mining
and machine learning. In particular, my research seeks to identify and
understand sequential patterns and dependencies in network data, such as
passenger movement through public transit systems, goods through
logistics networks, or users navigating the Web. I am also interested in
using machine learning to improve partially observed (sampled) network
data, as well as the limitations of machine learning in solving network
problems.</p>

id="understanding-higher-order-correlations-in-pathway-data">Understanding
Higher Order Correlations in Pathway Data</h6>
<p>Data representing pathways or sequences of nodes traversed in a
network, such as people moving through a public transit system or
navigating hyperlinks on the Web, is commonly studied in Network
Science. Traditionally, network scientists studied such data by
aggregating it into weighted networks, destroying sequential or temporal
correlations in the process. More recently, researchers have begun to
dig in to these temporal correlations to understand mechanisms of
pathway generation and how this generation impacts network structure. I
am interested in studying “higher order networks” (specifically De
Bruijn graph representations) to better understand pathway data on its
own terms. I am also interested in connecting the sequential pattern
mining literatures, developed in large part by the computer science/data
mining community, with perspectives and approaches developed more
recently by network scientists.</p>

<h6 id="sequential-motifs-from-pathway-data">Sequential Motifs from
Pathway Data</h6>
<p>We use DeBruijn graphs to extend the concept of motifs as building
blocks of complex networks to pathway data, studying <em>sequential
motifs</em>. We use the fact that a weighted edge in a <em>kth</em>
order DeBruijn graph represents the frequency of a length <em>k</em>
path through a network, and that these edges can be mapped into a common
motif space. We show that analyzing motifs based on pathway data using
traditional static-network techniques can be misleading if the static
structure encodes patterns that are possible based on the structure
alone, but do not actually appear in the pathway data. Beyond counting,
we can also compare the overall frequency of motif structures with their
frequency after applying HYPA, a null model for DeBruijn graphs that
identifies paths observed significantly more or less often than
expected. This analysis provides insight into the mesoscale navigation
patterns that drive microscale interactions between nodes.</p>

Analysis of Global Shipping Network Data</h6>
<p>Preliminary work studying a dataset of global shipping routes. We
build on previous work studying shipping route data, contributing a
<em>path-centric</em> approach that takes advantage of sequential
information in the shipping routes. In place of the shortest paths that
were central to previous work, we focus on <em>minimum-route</em> paths,
or paths that use the minimum number of transfers between shipping
routes. We find that previous work overestimated the role of nodes and
edges through the “structural core” of the network as defined by that
work.</p>

<h6 id="resampling-partially-observed-network-data">Resampling Partially
Observed Network Data</h6>
<p>In network science, we often deal with partially observed data, such
as sampled interactions on social media gathered from Twitter. In many
circumstances, we have some resource limited ability to resample the
data, for example by accessing an API. In our work, we develop methods
for the following scenario: You are given a sample of a larger network,
the ability to query nodes in the sample to learn more accurate
information about them (such as their true neighborhood or attribute
labels), and a function that provides a mathematical reward given the
outcome of a query. The goal of our methods is to learn to predict which
nodes one should query to maximize reward in their sample.</p>
