I am a doctoral candidate in Network Science at the Northeastern University [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org), advised by [Professor Tina Eliassi-Rad](https://www.eliassi.org). Prior to joining the Institute in 2016, I completed a BS in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Philosophy at the State University of New York at Albany, where I conducted research on load balancing in cellular networks and unsupervised transmitter detection in wireless frequency spectrum data, under the supervision of Prof. Petko Bogdanov and Prof. Mariya Zheleva.
