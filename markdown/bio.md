I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Oxford Mathematical Institute, working with [Professor Renaud Lambiotte](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/renaud.lambiotte) on modeling multi-way interaction data on networks. In December 2021 I earned my PhD in Network Science at the Northeastern University [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org), where I was advised by [Professor Tina Eliassi-Rad](https://www.eliassi.org) and specialized in the analysis of higher-order sequential correlations in network data. Prior to joining the Institute in 2016, I completed a BS in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Philosophy at the State University of New York at Albany, where I conducted research on load balancing in cellular networks and unsupervised transmitter detection in wireless frequency spectrum data, under the supervision of Prof. Petko Bogdanov and Prof. Mariya Zheleva.
