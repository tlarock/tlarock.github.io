I am a third year doctoral student in Network Science at Northeastern University's Network Science Institute, advised by [Tina Eliassi-Rad](www.eliassi.org). Prior to joining the Institute in 2016, I completed a BS in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Philosophy at the State University of New York at Albany, where I conducted research on load balancing in cellular networks and unsupervised transmitter detection in wireless frequency spectrum data, under the supervision of Prof. Petko Bogdanov and Prof. Mariya Zheleva.
