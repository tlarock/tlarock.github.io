## <a name="research"></a> Research
My research falls at the intersection of network science, data mining and machine learning. In particular, my research seeks to identify and understand sequential patterns and dependencies in network data, such as passenger movement through public transit systems, goods through logistics networks, or users navigating the Web. I am also interested in using machine learning to improve partially observed (sampled) network data, as well as the limitations of machine learning in solving network problems.

The best way to find my publications is through my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kAaxRkUAAAAJ&hl=en).
