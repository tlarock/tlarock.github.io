###### Understanding Higher Order Correlations in Pathway Data
Data representing pathways or sequences of nodes traversed in a network, such as people moving through a public transit system or navigating hyperlinks on the Web, is commonly studied in Network Science. Traditionally, network scientists studied such data by aggregating it into weighted networks, destroying sequential or temporal correlations in the process. More recently, researchers have begun to dig in to these temporal correlations to understand mechanisms of pathway generation and how this generation impacts network structure. I am interested in studying "higher order networks" (specifically De Bruijn graph representations) to better understand pathway data on its own terms. I am also interested in connecting the sequential pattern mining literatures, developed in large part by the computer science/data mining community, with perspective and approaches developed more recently by network scientists.


###### Resampling Partially Observed Network Data
In network science, we often deal with partially observed data, such as sampled interactions on social media gathered from Twitter. In many circumstances, we have some resource limited ability to resample the data, for example by accessing an API. In our work, we develop methods for the following scenario: You are given a sample of a larger network, the ability to query nodes in the sample to learn more accurate information about them (such as their true neighborhood or attribute labels), and a function that provides a mathematical reward given the outcome of a query. The goal of our methods is to learn to predict which nodes one should query to maximize reward in their sample.
